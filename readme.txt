--Readme document for Johnathon Valles--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

12/14
- 1/1 Readme
- 3/3 Basic HTML content
- 3/3 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/3 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 1/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
    - Included 4 images, each with a descriptive alt text.
    - Used appropriate headings (h1, h2) and paragraph text in the landing, about, and project sections.
    - Linked to external pages in the navigation (e.g., instagram, github)
    - Linked to external pages in the project cards section (e.g., github, archangel).
    - Utilized semantic HTML tags (e.g., header, nav, main, article, footer).
    - Utilized custom icons from Font Awesome (e.g., navigation & project cards).

(b) CSS features
    - Modified padding & margins to indent content & enhance readability (e.g., landing page, about section, projects section).
    - Modified link tags & text colors to display site content in a more visually appealing manner.
    - Leveraged Bootstrap 5 CSS helpers when styling the structuring the contact form.
    - Utilized custom Google Fonts (e.g., Anton, Oswald) and added appropriate fallback fonts.
    - Utilized a media query to enhance the site's navigation of varying viewport dimensions.
    - Utilized a media query to enhance the way the project cards are displayed on larger viewports.

(c) Advanced features
    - I didn't like the built-in navigation elements from Bootstrap 5. Therefore, I constructed a custom navigation. On smaller screens (<= 992px), the navigation is styled such that only a menu toggle button is
    displayed in the upper right-hand corner. Upon clicking/tapping the button, the menu slides out from the left side of the screen. Additionally, when the viewport width is larger (>= 992px), the navigation
    is styled such that it appears fixed at the top of the viewport.
    - The projects section on smaller viewport widths displays all project cards vertically. On larger viewports, the project cards are displayed such that there are 3 columns and rows.
    - Leveraged CSS selectors (e.g., nested, child sibling selector '>') to specify the structure of the portfolio content.
    - Created a contact form with basic client-side validation. Additionally, the contact form is styled using Bootstrap 5 helpers to manage the dimensions of the form as the viewport dimensions change.

3. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
    - 38 hours (3-6 hour intervals of work)
    - I found the design process the most challenging and time-consuming.

    - Consulted some of my classmates (David Branson, Tom Ustundag) from INF 133 regarding the design process, ideas, and tools.
    - Consulted with friends outside the CS/INF departments by allowing them to navigate the portfolio while providing feedback on the usability & design.

6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
    - Nothing special.
    - Tested the code by deploying it to GitHub pages to ensure it runs.
